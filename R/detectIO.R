#
# This function serves to detect whether there is any IO. It implements the
# test statistic lambda_{1,t} proposed by Chang, Chen and Tiao (1988).
#
# input: 
#       object=an ARMA model
#       alpha=family significance level (5% is the default)
#             Bonferroni rule is used to control the family error rate.
#       robust=if true, the noise standard deviation is estimated by
#               mean absolute residuals times sqrt(pi/2). Otherwise,
#               it is the estimated by sqrt(sigma2) from the arima fit.
# side effects: print the test statistics of the found IO and their time indices.
#
# output:
#        a list containing the time indices, named ind, and the test statistics of the found
#        IO, named lambda1
#
#
